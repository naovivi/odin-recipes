<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These are the best molasses cookies that will ever exist. They are a part of my soul. I have been eating them since my mother 
    made them for me as a child. I always thought she got the recipe from a special cookbook authored by a professional
    baker, but it turns out they are actually a Pillsbury recipe. No shade; I'm just surprised.
</p>
<p>Also...Pillsbury calls them "Frosted Ginger Cutouts"</p>
<p>These cookies are superior with their heavy molasses flavor and smooth surface. The icing is also a work of art with its sugary shell and 
    chalky but not dry interior. If you eat it at the right time in the drying process, the inside has the consistency of a marshmallow.
    Who hates marshmallows? Nobody.
