  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>I fuckin' love pretzels. I don't know if it's because of my German ancestry or what, but soft pretzels float through
      my veins, so here's a recipe for that. 
    </p>
    <p>I love all kinds of pretzels, but I get a hankering for the soft ones often because they're
        so hard to find here in Japan. If I use this recipe, I can make my own.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>warm water</li>
        <li>1 packet of yeast</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>flour</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Let the yeast foam in the warm water for a few minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients and mix. You can use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, a hand mixer, or– like you’ll notice in the video– no mixer at all. Work with what you have in the kitchen.</li>
       <li>Guess what? You don’t have to wait to let this dough rise. YES! Well, we’ll let it rest for 10 minutes while you get the baking soda + water boiling on the stove but that’s it. Don’t have any patience? This is the recipe for you. By the way, did you know that some pretzel recipes call for rising overnight? They’re remarkable pretzels but I’m satisfied with this ultra quick dough!</li>
       <li>Roll 1/3 cup of dough into a long 20-22 inch rope. Twist the ends and bring the ends down. That’s a pretzel!</li>
       <li>Now drop the pretzels into the boiling water + baking soda. Let them boil for 20-30 seconds each, then place onto a baking sheet. This pretzel dough makes 12 regular size soft pretzels, so I use 2 baking sheets. 6 on each. Sprinkle with salt and bake in a hot oven. That’s it, you’re done.</li>
   </ol>
